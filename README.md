ever gets your computer password you can always be reasured with Erbium's second password system.

Erbium every time you run it. You have always 3 attempts to put in the correct password that you have setup. 
Once Erbium is running and you clicked a 90 second timer will set of if you dont put in the correct password in the 90 
seconds your computer will shut off. If you dont put in the correct password in the 3 attempts your computer will shut off.
Also make a shortcut of erbium.exe and add it to your startup folder so that it will run every 
time you open your computer just remember to put in the password every time you open your computer or else it 
will shut off. You can find the start up folder by pressing "Windows + R" and typing in shell:startup. Put the
shortcut of erbium.exe in there.

you need to press enter.
